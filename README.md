## Introduction
This is a simple GUI program that mass-checks a txt file containing IPs and displays the average latency for each one.
This program was mainly written as an exercise in learning GUI programming through the tkinter library.

## How to use
Simply run the python file from the command line by navigating to the directory it is downloaded and typing "python pingchecker.py".
To mass-check a list of IPs, first ensure you have a .txt file containing an IP on each line. Then, open the program and access the "open"
option from the "file" dropdown menu. Once you've navigated to the file and opened it, the program will display the average latency for each IP listed in the file.
